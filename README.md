# GTA-IV-Realistic-Fuel-Mod
This script has been modified by Gemei, and is based on the Ultimate Fuel Script v2.1.0.0 and Realistic Fuel Script 2.3.145.20929 which was developed by Pedro Rodrigues & Sandakelum.
I have ported the mod to work with the latest version of GTA IV Complete Edition 1.2.0.43.

INSTALLATION 
Just unzip extract the contents of the ZIP file you downloaded to
GTA IV root directory folder. Keep the folders and paths intact.

WARNING 
This script also shares Ultimate Fuel Script's GUID (which is
3583e09d-6c44-4820-85e9-93926307d4f8). So don't use these two script together
or it will cause a conflict in some events.

USAGE
You don't need to worry, every help and which keys you should use will be
provided to you as ingame instructions when you using this script. And almost
everything is customizable to your needs.

HELPFUL DOWNLOADS
If you need to change the display location of the fuel meter, consider using the DashboardPositioner.exe tool.

FAQ
Q. GTA prompted an error  GTA IV FATAL ERROR Invalid resource detected - Please re-install the game.
A. Just retry, the error should be gone. It sometimes happens when running the script for the first time.

A. Yes, use a trainer (Simple Native Trainer is recommended) and take note of the HASH code for that specific car.

The values specified in this new entry should be loaded for your added cars, there is no limit to how many entries you can have.
